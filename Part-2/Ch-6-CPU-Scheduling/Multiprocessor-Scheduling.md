# Multiprocessor Scheduling

Multiprocessor scheduling addresses the complex challenge of efficiently allocating CPU resources across multiple processing cores while maintaining system performance, cache coherence, and load balance. Modern multicore systems have fundamentally changed scheduling requirements, demanding algorithms that consider processor topology, memory hierarchies, and inter-processor communication overhead.

## Multiprocessor System Architecture and Challenges

Symmetric Multiprocessing (SMP) systems feature multiple processors with equal access to shared memory and I/O resources, creating a uniform programming model but introducing complex scheduling challenges. Each processor can potentially execute any process, providing flexibility but requiring sophisticated coordination mechanisms.

Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) architectures organize processors into nodes with local memory, where accessing remote memory incurs significant latency penalties. NUMA-aware scheduling must consider memory locality when making scheduling decisions to minimize remote memory access overhead.

Cache coherence protocols ensure memory consistency across processors but introduce performance overhead when multiple processors access the same memory locations. Scheduling decisions significantly impact cache performance through false sharing, cache line bouncing, and memory bandwidth contention.

Load balancing becomes critical in multiprocessor systems because uneven load distribution leads to poor resource utilization and degraded performance. However, frequent process migration to achieve perfect load balance may hurt performance due to cache pollution and migration overhead.

## Scheduling Approaches for Multiprocessor Systems

Asymmetric multiprocessing dedicates specific processors to particular functions, with one master processor handling all scheduling decisions and other processors executing assigned tasks. This approach simplifies synchronization but creates potential bottlenecks and fails to utilize processor resources efficiently.

Symmetric multiprocessing allows all processors to participate in scheduling decisions, either through a single shared ready queue or multiple per-processor queues. Shared queue approaches provide automatic load balancing but require expensive synchronization for queue access.

Per-processor queues eliminate synchronization overhead for queue operations but require explicit load balancing mechanisms to distribute work evenly across processors. This approach scales better but complicates load distribution and may lead to idle processors while others are overloaded.

Processor affinity mechanisms attempt to maintain processes on the same processor to preserve cache locality, trading perfect load balance for better cache performance. Soft affinity provides preference for previous processors while allowing migration when necessary, while hard affinity prevents migration entirely.

## Load Balancing Algorithms and Strategies

Push migration algorithms actively move processes from overloaded processors to less loaded ones when load imbalances are detected. These algorithms monitor processor utilization and trigger migration when thresholds are exceeded, providing proactive load distribution.

Pull migration allows idle or lightly loaded processors to steal work from busy processors, implementing a demand-driven load balancing approach. Work stealing algorithms enable idle processors to examine other processors' queues and migrate suitable processes.

Load balancing frequency affects both system overhead and load distribution quality. Frequent balancing provides better load distribution but increases overhead, while infrequent balancing reduces overhead but may allow significant load imbalances to persist.

Migration costs include direct overhead from moving process state and indirect costs from cache pollution and lost locality. Effective load balancing algorithms must weigh migration benefits against these costs to make optimal decisions.

## NUMA-aware Scheduling Considerations

NUMA topology significantly impacts scheduling decisions because memory access latency varies based on the processor-memory relationship. Local memory access provides much better performance than remote access, making processor-memory proximity a critical scheduling consideration.

Memory allocation policies interact closely with scheduling decisions to optimize NUMA performance. Local allocation policies attempt to allocate memory on the same NUMA node as the requesting processor, while interleaved allocation distributes memory across nodes for load balancing.

Process placement strategies consider NUMA topology when making initial scheduling decisions, preferring to place processes on nodes with available local memory. Migration policies must balance load distribution with NUMA locality to maintain optimal memory access patterns.

NUMA-aware load balancing recognizes that moving processes between NUMA nodes incurs significant performance penalties, making same-node load balancing preferable to cross-node migration when possible.

## Gang Scheduling and Synchronization

Gang scheduling addresses the coordination requirements of parallel applications by ensuring that related processes execute simultaneously across multiple processors. This synchronization prevents performance degradation that occurs when communicating processes are scheduled at different times.

Parallel applications often require tight coordination among their component processes, with performance heavily dependent on simultaneous execution. When gang members are scheduled independently, communication delays and synchronization overhead can severely impact application performance.

Space sharing allocates a fixed set of processors to parallel applications for their entire execution duration, providing guaranteed simultaneous execution but potentially poor processor utilization when applications have varying parallelism requirements.

Time sharing with gang scheduling periodically schedules entire process groups simultaneously across multiple processors, enabling multiple parallel applications to share the system while maintaining coordination within each application.

Coscheduling mechanisms detect when processes attempt to communicate and ensure that communicating processes are scheduled simultaneously, providing coordination benefits without requiring explicit gang formation.

## Contemporary Multiprocessor Scheduling Trends

Modern multiprocessor scheduling faces new challenges from heterogeneous computing architectures, energy efficiency requirements, and containerized workloads. These trends drive the development of sophisticated scheduling algorithms that adapt to diverse hardware capabilities and application requirements.

Heterogeneous multiprocessor systems combine different types of processing units, such as high-performance cores, energy-efficient cores, and specialized accelerators. Scheduling for these systems requires matching workload characteristics to appropriate processing units while managing power consumption and thermal constraints.

Energy-aware scheduling considers power consumption alongside performance metrics, using techniques such as dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS), core parking, and thermal management to optimize energy efficiency. These approaches balance performance requirements with power constraints in mobile and server environments.

Container orchestration platforms introduce new scheduling requirements for managing containerized applications across distributed multiprocessor systems. These platforms must consider resource isolation, quality of service requirements, and application dependencies when making scheduling decisions.

Machine learning integration enables adaptive scheduling systems that learn from workload patterns and system behavior to make optimal scheduling decisions. These systems can predict application resource requirements, detect performance anomalies, and automatically tune scheduling parameters.

The evolution of multiprocessor scheduling continues as systems become increasingly complex and diverse. Future developments will likely focus on intelligent, adaptive scheduling systems that can automatically optimize performance across heterogeneous hardware platforms while meeting diverse application requirements and system constraints. Understanding fundamental multiprocessor scheduling principles provides the foundation for addressing these emerging challenges and developing next-generation scheduling systems that effectively utilize modern multiprocessor architectures.
