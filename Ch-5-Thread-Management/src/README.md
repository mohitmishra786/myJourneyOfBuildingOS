## Key Concepts Demonstrated

### 1. Thread Models

- True parallelism on multicore systems
- Higher overhead for creation and switching
- Independent blocking behavior
- Full OS scheduler integration

- Amortized thread creation costs
- Efficient task distribution
- Resource management and scaling
- Queue-based work distribution

### 2. Synchronization Mechanisms

**Mutexes:**
- Critical section protection
- Deadlock prevention through ordering
- Performance impact analysis

**Condition Variables:**
- Event-driven coordination
- Producer-consumer patterns
- Spurious wakeup handling

**Semaphores:**
- Resource counting and management

## Performance Considerations

### Compilation Optimizations

The examples can be compiled with various optimization levels:

```bash
# Debug build (no optimization, full debugging info)
make debug

# Standard build (moderate optimization)
make

# Performance build (aggressive optimization)
make performance
```

### Profiling and Analysis

Use the provided analysis targets to identify performance bottlenecks:

```bash
# Thread sanitizer for race condition detection
make tsan
./thread_synchronization_demo

# Address sanitizer for memory error detection
make asan
./thread_models_demo

# Memory leak analysis with valgrind
make memcheck
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Race Conditions

**Problem:** Unpredictable program behavior due to unsynchronized shared data access.

**Solution:** Use appropriate synchronization primitives (mutexes, atomic operations) to protect critical sections.

**Example:** The race condition demonstration shows both the problem and the mutex-based solution.

### Deadlocks

**Problem:** Circular wait conditions causing permanent thread blocking.

**Solution:** Implement consistent lock ordering, use timeouts, or employ deadlock detection algorithms.

**Example:** The deadlock prevention demonstration shows ordered locking techniques.

### Performance Bottlenecks

**Problem:** Poor performance due to excessive synchronization overhead.

**Solution:** Use appropriate granularity for locking, consider lock-free algorithms, or optimize critical section length.

**Example:** Performance comparison between different thread models highlights overhead trade-offs.

### Memory Leaks

**Problem:** Allocated memory not properly freed in multithreaded programs.

**Solution:** Implement proper cleanup procedures, use RAII patterns, and employ memory analysis tools.

**Example:** All examples demonstrate proper resource cleanup and error handling.

## Troubleshooting

### Build Issues

**Missing pthread library:**

sudo yum install glibc-devel
```

**Compiler warnings:**
The examples are compiled with strict warning flags. Address any warnings that appear during compilation.

### Runtime Issues
